# tanks-game
copy of group project from university gitlab
It's a game of tanks. It can be player vs bot, or player vs player. There are few maps from which players can choose and there is system of keeping score and upgrades.
Project was entirely made in visual studio 2022. There were four people working on project. I was responsible for game logic and bots.
